Public repository of the scripts used in this study.
Youseph Ibrahim and Patrice Rey 2022.


Files:

KC2.py is the script used to run experiment KC2, with the ductile flow mechanism of isostasy and a scaling density of 6000 kg (m<sup>3</sup>).
LF2.py is the script used to run experiment LF2, which uses GFlex to implement lithospheric flexure with a lithospheric elastic thickness of 20 km.

Models were run using UWGeo v2.9
